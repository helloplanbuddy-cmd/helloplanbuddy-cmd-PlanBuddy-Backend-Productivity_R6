-- Financial Integrity v7: Enforce single payment/booking + partial refund fields
-- SAFE: Backup + additive only + concurrent indexes + NOTICE logs. Reversible.

BEGIN;

-- 1. Backup (reversible)
-- Create a full backup table only if it doesn't exist yet (avoids column-mismatch on repeated runs)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'payments_backup_v7') THEN
    CREATE TABLE payments_backup_v7 AS SELECT * FROM payments;
  END IF;
END;
$$;
-- Log backup row count
SELECT 'Backup created: payments_backup_v7' AS notice, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments) AS rows;

-- 2. Report duplicates/inconsistencies (NOTICE only)
SELECT 'Duplicates' AS notice, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT booking_id, COUNT(*) FROM payments GROUP BY booking_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) d) AS count;
SELECT 'Refunds' AS notice, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE status IN ('refunded', 'partially_refunded')) AS count;
SELECT 'Inconsistent captured' AS notice, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments p JOIN bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id WHERE p.status = 'captured' AND b.payment_status != 'paid') AS count;
SELECT 'Inconsistent refunded' AS notice, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments p JOIN bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id WHERE p.status = 'refunded' AND b.payment_status != 'refunded') AS count;

-- 3. Add fields (additive, safe defaults)
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS refunded_amount NUMERIC(12,2) DEFAULT 0 CHECK (refunded_amount >= 0 AND refunded_amount <= amount);
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS refund_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'none' CHECK (refund_status IN ('none', 'processing', 'succeeded', 'failed'));
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS refund_processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- 4. Enforce single row per booking (fails if duplicates exist)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS payments_booking_id_unique ON payments(booking_id);

-- 5. Extend status CHECK
ALTER TABLE payments DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS payments_status_check;
ALTER TABLE payments ADD CONSTRAINT payments_status_check 
  CHECK (status IN ('created', 'captured', 'failed', 'refunded', 'partially_refunded', 'refund_failed'));

-- 6. Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_refund_status ON payments(booking_id, status, refund_status);
